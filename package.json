It's actually a single EditorWindow script file, and it's very useful.\r\n\r\n- Channel/Listener System - This system allows to create ScriptableObject Event and listener.\r\n Multiple listeners can listen to the same value and execute it for different tasks.\r\n\nFor example: Let's have a Float Event Channel of the player's health, \r\na Listener to see it as the UI changes, and another system to check if the health is 0 or not. At this point, \r\nwe separate the UI and the life-checking system. But our value comes from the same place.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Channel && Listener Class Generator - As the name suggests, it is a tool for creating Channel and Listener classes. \r\nThis is so that we can create a Channel and listener at the same time according to any type. And make it easy to add them to the project.\r\n\r\n- Json Scriptable Save System - This is the save system,\r\nConverts Data -> to Json -> Encrypts it -> Creates a file named Game_Data in the Assets folder and writes it into it.\r\nReads game_data -> Decodes -> Loads values. (its working on Android/IOS/Windows, tested before)\r\n\r\n- Utils - Utils includes many helpful, functions for speed up coding. \r\nEx: myList.GetRandomItem() - it is give you random item from List or \r\n\"Hello, World\".Log(); it is increase your speed when write Log Message\n\n- All codes is under the IA namespace, ex: IA.Utils",
